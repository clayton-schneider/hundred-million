        Kailash Satyarthi has been a tireless advocate of children’s rights for
        over three decades. In 2014, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace

        The 100 Million campaign is a youth-led call to action for a world where
        all young people are free, safe and educated. We support young people in
        mobilizing to end violence against children, eradicate child labour, and
        ensure education, breaking the cycles of illiteracy, poverty and
        violence for good.

        Inspired by the powerful voices of young activists around the world who
        are leading change in their communities, the 100 Million campaign was
        launched in India at the end of 2016, by 6,000 young people, standing
        side by side with Nobel Peace Laureate, and renowned child rights
        activist, Kailash Satyarthi. With support from the <a

          >Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation</a
        >, the campaign has worked to bring together impassioned young activists
        from every background to mobilise and advocate for the rights of the
        world’s most excluded children.
      </p>
      <p>
        The campaign has established itself in 35 countries on five continents
        by bringing together youth activists with NGOs and teacher unions and
        supporting their mobilization and advocacy activities with campaigning
        materials, policy briefings and face-to-face meetings.
