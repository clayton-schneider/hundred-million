          Youth activists, student leaders, survivor-advocates and their
          representative organizations across Africa are coming together and
          demanding justice. Amplified by solidarity actions from their peers
          around the world, they are demanding urgent action that delivers
          Justice for Africa. To learn more about the campaign on a global
          scale, <a

          In the US, youth activists engaged in a wide variety of solidarity
          actions on the 20th. From coast to coast, students stood with signs in
          front of important buildings in their communities, flyered, and
          chalked.

          From coast to coast, young people created art pieces, took photos,
          made videos, and took to the streets to show their solidarity. Justice
          for Africaâ€™s Children is just getting started. <a
