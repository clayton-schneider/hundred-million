          Youth activists, student leaders, survivor-advocates and their
          representative organizations across Africa are coming together and
          demanding justice. Amplified by solidarity actions from their peers
          around the world, they are demanding urgent action that delivers
          Justice for Africa. <a

          In the US, youth activists engaged in a wide variety of solidarity
          actions on the 20th of February. From coast to coast, students stood
          with signs in front of important buildings in their communities,
          flyered, and chalked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young people created art pieces, took photos, made videos, and took to
          the streets to show their solidarity. Justice for Africaâ€™s Children is
          just getting started.
